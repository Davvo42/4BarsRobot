Modelling and Control of a 4-bar robot. The report is self explicative and it comprises
- Introduction to the plant
- System kinematics analysis 
- Determination of the operational area
- Model Identification
- Feedback control in the state space
- state space control
- Advanced controller implementation (MPC)

The code provided is fully in Matlab, which was used both for the simulation and the testing on the real plant. The full manual is also provided.

The project was made for the course of AUTOMATION AND CONTROL LABORATORY at Politecnico di Milano
